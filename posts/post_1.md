## Book 1

Since we have largely covered in class the discussion on the dialogues between Socrates and Cephalus, and between Socrates and Polemarchus, I would like to discuss some of my thoughts on the relatively more vast and interesting dialogue that occurs between Socrates and Thrasymachus.

**Some interesting points in the dialogue**

- **337e**: Socrates admits here that he actually doesn't claim to have any knowledge of the subject of justice.
- **338d**: Thrasymachus makes a fair point in my opinion, when he criticizes Socrates for presenting a very weak version of the proposition he put forth. Technically, due to the vagueness of Thrasymachus' proposition, it is true the Socrates is not wrong in asking for a clarification, but he did give a relatively bad interpretation for it as an example. One possible issue with a complex problem like the nature of justice is that the attempt to specify a proposition with greater precision would perhaps make it more prone to errors, or provide greater loopholes that can be exploited to bring the entire argument down, which might be considered slightly disingenuous if the true goal of the discussion is to arrive at a better understanding of the problem rather than simply show a specific argument to be false.
- **339b**: This is an interesting and somewhat rare point, where Socrates seems to agree on something - he accepts that justice does have something to do with 'interest' of some sort.
- **346a-e:** Socrates makes a distinction between professional skill, which by itself doesn't benefit the self, and wage-earning, which does benefit the self.
- **351c:** Thrasymachus finally starts thinking outside the plain "yes"/"no" answers, and Socrates even praises this.
- **354b:** Socrates here seems to make the claim that he actually doesn't know with certainty himself regarding the various propositions he put forth (such as 'a just person is good and wise', etc). This probably might suggest that either he has a reasonable intuitive sense that makes him inclined to thinking those propositions are likely to be true, or he simply arrived at those propositions as part of the arguments he had, by trying to find flaws in his opponents' propositions.

**Points of apparent fallacies by Socrates**

- **334b**: Socrates makes a fallacy of treating the 'ability of one to steal' as equivalent to 'being a thief'. This raises an interesting thought on whether it is simply a mistake he makes in his reasoning, or whether he is well aware of it (and is perhaps testing Polemarchus?).
- **349b - 350c:** Socrates does not seem to give a very good argument. He makes the use of "compete with like ... and unlike ..." in two different contexts (one in just and unjust, and the other for craftsmen), which he seems to have equated. Also, he uses a specific instance of the idea of "good" (in the context of having good ability at a craft), and appears to draw a more general conclusion from it, even though the nature of being "good and sensible" for just and unjust persons is not clear.
- **352a:** He makes another broad statement here, where he makes the conclusion that 'injustice', in the general sense, renders incapable _any_ common action. However, he does clarify this ahead in **352c**, where he uses the term "complete injustice".
- **353e**: He makes a strange conclusion here, which appears to not meet further reasoning. From the proposition that 'injustice would imply a defected mind' he shows that an unjust person cannot have a good life, since having a good life in a function of the mind. However, if a defected mind were to imply a loss in quality of all its functions (which appears to be an assumption Socrates has used without explicitly stating it), then that should also give us conclusions that an unjust person would be worse at paying attention, controlling, etc., functions that he himself stated as that of the mind, but it is not clear at all whether that is truly always the case in the real world.

**A general view on the nature of Socrates, and his argument to counter Thrasymachus' main proposition**

From the discussion, particularly between Socrates and Thrasymachus, it seems quite clear that despite the various fallacies that exist in his arguments, Socrates is an extremely intelligent person. One particular instance from the text that, in my opinion, would strongly suggest such a conclusion is from **341c - 342c**, where Socrates considers Thrasymachus' idea that 'justice is whatever is in the interest of the rulers qua rulers', and creates, within a relatively short span of dialogue, a very complex reasoning to break it down and counter it.

He starts out, through analogy, to arrive at his first proposition, that a ruler qua ruler would really be one that is a practitioner of their job of specifying and handling matters of justice (just like a doctor qua doctor is really a medical practitioner, and not a businessman, else he may be a doctor but not a doctor _qua doctor_). This first proposition by itself does not seem too much of a problem yet, since even if a ruler qua ruler practices that task, according to Thrasymachus it would still be for serving his own interests. The interesting thought comes up in Socrates' next idea, where he effectively states that any skill is practiced for serving some interest other than simply its basic interest of self-perfection, by making the argument that if there were no other purpose to meet, then the skill, in its own state would be completely unflawed (due to the non-existence of any reference to define a concept of 'improvement'). Through this, along with the first proposition, he arrives at the conclusion that the ruler qua ruler performs his task of specifying justice, which cannot only have a purpose of self-perfection, but must also serve as a purpose the interests of that for which the skill itself exists in the first place, i.e. to help serve people in society. This entire argument and its swift construction, seems to indicate that Socrates is clearly a person with very high verbal and analytical intelligence.

Ahead of this, in **342d,e** I do think however, that there may be a slight flaw in the conclusion Socrates finally makes through this argument. He seems correct in stating that a skill is not practiced simply for the interest of the skill itself, but this does not seem to disallow the skill from serving the interests of the practitioner of that skill (i.e. the ruler qua ruler). Socrates, however, has strongly stated that _no_ ruler qua ruler exercises his authority for his own interests, and he only exercises it to serve the interests of his people.

## Book 2

**Broad Overview**

Book 2 begins with an argument by Glaucon and Adeimantus in favor of injustice, and is followed by Socrates trying to counter this through an elaborate investigation, where he aims to discover the origins of justice and injustice by developing an understanding of how society itself originates, and why the various elements in society are required. However, this investigation remains incomplete till the end of Book 2, and further extends into Book 3, and so a complete analysis of Socrates' overall argument cannot be made at the moment.

**Some key points in Book 2**

- **359a** : Glaucon presents a nihilistic view of justice (as being only a set of compromises that people agree upon to live together as a community, but would not agree to if they were only 'smart enough' to make no mistakes and maintain a just image in everyone's mind).
- **361d** : Glaucon here clarifies that he actually believes that justice is good, contrary to what might seem from the argument he has been making. It is only that he wants to hear from Socrates an argument that can justify this.
- **369b** : Socrates gives the reason for the origin of society - that individuals themselves are not self-sufficient.
- **370b** : Socrates recognizes that people are born with different aptitudes.
- **374d** : Socrates calls the work of the defense force as the most important of all (which may be reasonable, as other skills might be of not much use if the society gets invaded and destroyed by enemies).
- **375b - 375e** : Socrates explains how guardians need to be 'good guardians' (i.e., nice to their own people).

**Some thoughts**

- **368d,e** **\-- (Justice in a community is larger than in the individual) --** : Socrates makes the argument that justice in a community is larger than in the individual. This seems to be a slightly vague assumption. One interpretation of it that might make it sound slightly reasonable might be if we consider that the "community" is being treated as a "collection of individuals", and in that sense is larger than a single individual. Since various individuals differ in various regards from one another, their individual relationships with the notion of justice might also differ. But the "justice of a community", i.e., "justice in a collection of individuals", may be understood as the justice associated with the 'essence of the individual' that is extracted out from the community, thus getting rid of the effects of individual distinctions between people. In this sense, the justice may be "larger" than that in a single individual, since different individuals may have various kinds of imperfect relationships with justice, but the 'essence of the individual' might be considered as having the correct relationship.
- **372e - 373a -- (Socrates' problem with 'desire' in society) --** : Socrates calls a society with the existence of 'desire' / 'lack of satisfaction' within its members, a society in "fever". This could be questionable, since the drive within people to do more than just what is sufficient for survival should seem to be that what makes humans special, in the sense of allowing us to have made progress and discoveries. Additionally, the motivation to achieve higher goals also appears to be closely linked to the sense of "meaning" in the lives of people, and a stagnant society might be one where such meaning is lacking, and thus may not be termed as "perfect". Another minor but legitimate issue with Socrates' picture of a "healthy society" is that it ignores the possibility of some random person to go 'crazy' at some arbitrary moment and go about causing havoc, destruction and killings (and considering a life with no 'adventure' as such, it is not out of the question that someone may act in such a way just to experience a twisted form of 'adventure' in their life). If such were to be a possibility, then shouldn't we need 'guardians' of some sort even in this society?
- **376a,b** : Here Socrates appears to make an over-generalization. He starts out with the claim that the guardians need to have the ability to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar, but from that he generalizes to the idea that they must thus need to have a 'love for learning'. Why do they need to love learning in general? Why can't they simply be required to love learning about that one particular skill alone?
- **377b,c -- ('Totalitarian-like' restrictions on stories) --** : This seems to be a very strange argument made by Socrates. Is it really correct to disallow children from reading certain kinds of stories? Well, perhaps if we were to talk of some extreme cases, like serious brutality, pornography, etc., it might be considered to have negative impacts on young children. But the examples of harmful stories used ahead (such as gods being misrepresented, etc.) does not appear to fall into such a category, and it is not clear why we should disallow anyone from reading such stories. The problem in fact is even bigger. Who decides which stories are right, and why do they get to decide that? How does one know whether there is truly nothing good that can come from reading such stories? This is just one part of the problem. The other problem is behind the motivation that Socrates seems to give for regulating stories - i.e., to ensure that the children have the "same opinions" as they 'think they should have when they grow up'. How do they know that they already have the perfect set of opinions? Why can't others have different opinions from them? This sort of regulation of the thoughts and culture of people by a group 'reformulating the way society should run' according to what they think is right seems to evoke patterns of totalitarianism.
- **377e** : Socrates says misrepresenting gods is a problem. While this in itself is questionable (considering that it does not encourage further philosophical analysis - such as, what do we mean by god? What are the features that god possesses, and are they logically compatible, etc.), but for the time being we can ignore this and treat it as mildly reasonable. But the line, "That is a fault which certainly deserves censure", doesn't appear to be a good implication nonetheless.
- **379b** **\-- (Assumption that god is good) --** : God has been assumed to be good. While that may be a shared belief in most cultures throughout history, it is still an assumption, and a big one, considering we haven't even defined what god is.
- **380d - 381c -- (God can't exist in other forms) --** : One problem with the argument seems to be that Socrates assumes that perfection can exist in only one form. Why is it not possible for there to be multiple forms that are equally perfect? (in whatever quantitative or qualitative sense the idea of "perfect" is supposed to be judged). On a light-hearted note, there are two thoughts I had, that I just felt were funny - If we hypothetically say that this argument and its conclusion were correct, then (i) the stories in religions like Hinduism, involving god taking up other forms, would apparently be shown to be logically inconsistent!, and (ii) if god, even of his own will, cannot take up another form, that seems to suggest that there exists something the he is incapable of doing, and thus is not omnipotent! This again would perhaps contradict many other religions, including the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam)! \[Of course, contradicting the ideas of a religion would not actually be a problem. This was just a funny observation\]

## Book 3

**Broad overview**

The overarching essence of the discourse in Book 3 (which is a continuation of the discussion from Book 2) is regarding the appropriate ways in which education should occur for the guardians of the ideal state, and this is expressed through various kinds of regulations on literature, music, love, and physical education.

**Interesting ideas**

- **388a :** Here instead of simply using "bad people" in general, Socrates uses the terms "less reputable" for women and "bad" for men. Just an observation, I'm not sure how to understand the exact reason behind it.
- **389c :** He makes a strange claim that "doctors" can be entrusted with falsehood and not laymen; and a generous interpretation may be that "doctor" is a placeholder for 'whoever is more capable at handling falsehood (for the greater good?)'. But instead, the meaning seems to be hijacked by replacing "doctor" with "ruler", as a kind of analogy. It is not clear whether allowing falsehood only for the powerful is a good idea. If we try to reconcile this with the generous interpretation, then that seems to imply that Socrates considers the rulers as the best at handling falsehood for the right purposes. Is this so?
- **389e - 390d** : Emphasis on the importance of self-restraint.
- **392d - 394c :** He describes three classes of poetry and fiction.
- **394e - 395b :** To what extent does the principle of specialization really apply? If we consider the idea that, "one cannot be good at more than one form of work", what does "work" here really refer to. This is important to specify, other we run into a regression problem - for instance: a poet may write tragedy, comedy, etc. But he can only be best at one. What about the further sub-categories? He can only be best at one of those... and so on, we can break apart any kind of activity into different categories based on the variations by which it can be performed, until either you are left with nothing, or perhaps with a kind of fundamentally basic, finite, purely repetitive activity/action.
- **395e :** If a man taking up the representation of a woman is disallowed, does that imply transgenderism is disallowed? (assuming here, that man and woman are used in the biological sense, and thus not allowing a man to take up the representation of a woman should disallow behavior associated with the female gender)
- **396d,e :** This has a striking similarity to what I have read (which is very little, unfortunately) about Aristotle's virtue ethics - i.e., a good action being that which would be performed by the virtuous man.
- **398a** : This is the first instance where a certain category of people are excluded from the ideal society.
- **400e :** He distinguishes naivety from goodness. Also, he related beauty and rhythm with good character.
- **401b** : Restrictions extended from poets to also include artists and craftsmen.
- **402c** : Recognition that the ones who train the guardians must also be properly educated to be able to recognize the virtuous qualities in the first place.
- **402d,e** : The person with whom the guardian will fall in love is that who will be harmonious in character and looks. But he also adds, that if the character is good, then "physical defects" will not be a barrier to affection.
- **403a** : Sex is considered the highest form of pleasure.
- **402e - 403b** : Excess pleasure is considered bad for self-control. However a fallacy seems to be made by equating it with "violence" and "indiscipline". It is also strange that Glaucon and Adeimantus don't seem to have any problem with this.  
    Also, Socrates argues that true love should involve no sexual contact at all, the argument for which appears flawed, since excess pleasure has been treated as a complete ill. Couldn't this be refined further? Maybe something better, like "having too frequent moments of excess pleasure" is not optimal, or "love that is completely consumed by sex" is not optimal?
- **403e** : Guardians are forbidden drunkenness. One interesting thing is that he does not forbid the "consumption of alcohol" in general, but specifically the 'drunk' state of mind and body. From a health perspective this seems quite correct, and also from the perspective of requirements of guardians to be alert and awake. One thought I had initially was, do guardians get some free off-duty periods of time? If so, then shouldn't they have the freedom to decide what to do with respect to their body/health? However, after more thought, this is not so simple, since, as a consequence of them being guardians, ensuring their health might be necessary for their job which can impact the lives of other people too.
- **405b** : He assumes that indisciplined behavior among the educated is only possible due to bad education. The possibility of an innate effect seems to be neglected (for instance, some kind of genetically acquired psychopathy).
- **405d - 406e** : Avoidance of excessive use of medication, and instead a preference towards self-maintenance of physical health. Socrates makes a big moral claim: That it is better to get on with life (while suffering from a chronic illness) and die, than to spend the entirety of life just getting the ailment treated. Analyzing this from an ethical standpoint, in terms of which decision is "more valuable" seems like an interesting task philosophically, although it is foreseeable how a literal legal enforcement of such a claim (without giving the illness-bearer a genuine freedom of choice) can lead to eugenics.
- **407a** : Claim made that the worth of life is in one's job.
- **408d - 409e** : Discussion on what is meant by a good doctor and judge.
- **409c,d** : An interesting point made, that a person of bad character, as a judge, would be cynical even of someone who is genuinely a good person.
- **410a** : People with corrupted psychological constitution are to be put to death! This appears to be a pretty controversial and questionable proposition (in the current times, we would instead imagine placing them in the appropriate institutions for people with psychiatric conditions).
- **410d** : A harmony of physical education and literary education is emphasized for a well developed mind (i.e., neither uncivilized and tough, nor soft and over-sensitive).
- **412b,c** : Guardians that will govern are taken as those who are the best among the elder guardians.
- **413a** : It is unclear what "true" and "false" mean here in the context of belief. Is it referring to the strength of the belief? Or, is it the factual knowledge of something being right/wrong? Because, contrary to what Socrates argues, it is not clear whether people always voluntarily let go of a false belief (sometimes people may cling on to irrational beliefs despite the awareness of the evidence against them).
- **414b - 415d** : This, according to me, was the weirdest portion of text throughout the discussion till now. It seems to endorse a very peculiar idea of creating a seemingly fake story and to essentially manipulate the entire population into believing it (pretty much like a religion, crafted by one person or a group, and injected into the society). The only rationale that comes to my mind at the moment is that the entire logical basis upon which the society exists (i.e., logic for all its rules and regulations and appropriate behaviors, etc.) is so dense and complex, that it can only be encoded into a kind of narrative that is digestible for the population to carry forward from generation to generation. The problem with this is - even if that were true, why cannot you (i.e., whoever has "figured out" the entire logic to societal structure) also write down the entire logical basis into some kind of book which may be read by people who are interested in it? And, if it is the case that no one really knows the entire logical basis, since the logic is complex beyond the understanding of anyone, then how do you write the myth at all, and why should we ensure belief in such a myth then?  
    It is hard to really interpret this, and the only reasonable understanding I can imagine of this is that perhaps only a vague, abstract, "approximate idea" of what the structure of society is like, is known, and that knowledge is of such nature that only a narrative form of it seems to be viable to construct, but it is not of such exact concrete nature that a set of axioms and logical arguments can be developed to perfectly describe it - i.e., by very nature you don't understand it perfectly, and so you leave it in a narrative form (with a fixed "basic structure" but not so fixed in possible interpretation) that can allow for adjustable interpretations for satisfying any future attempts at reasoning with it to arrive at the right logical ideas. The issue with this is, firstly that although it may work to a certain extent, it certainly would lead to major issues of enforcing wrong/immoral interpretations in society (which is a problem that actual religions suffer from). Secondly, if that were really the case, then why is this not clarified at all (since it appeared to us instead, throughout this discussion up till now, that we were trying to use _reason_ to arrive at an understanding of society and justice)?
- **416d** : He says guardians should not own private property.

**Some thoughts on interpreting this entire dialogue**

There is an interesting discussion that can be had with regards to the close relationship of the ideas presented by Socrates, and modern day issues of censorship, especially in the context of art and literature, which are supposed to be things which deal with, at a very fundamental level, the true freedom of thought and expression.

There however may be one interpretation that may resolve this problem: by considering the entirety of the discussion as being about constructing an ideal state, where everything should run harmoniously, and this process of constructing it is only an abstract constructive process taking place in the mind, only as a means to arrive at the idea of the ideal state, and not meant to be replicated in actuality as the physical means of arriving at the ideal state. This is in contrast to our notion of starting out with an actual non-ideal society, and then trying to transform it into the ideal through means such as censorship, etc. If we consider this picture, then the ideal state would have the kind of literature it does, not because someone cut out the bad parts, but because that was really the way it has always been, and similarly, everyone acts in accordance with all the other guidelines as laid down by Socrates, simply because that just happened to be that way ever since the origin of the state. Essentially it can be considered as a "perfect coincidence", where all the pieces by complete luck fit into the right place to end up in the form of an ideal state where everything may thus run harmoniously, and such harmonious behavior continues to be followed throughout time. Of course, it is obvious that this sounds absurd in terms of simply the sheer statistical improbability of it, but anyways it could be used as an interpretation that makes sense. In this interpretation, it would be implied that although we can recognize this description of the state as being the ideal, we cannot arrive at it, since the very process that would allow us to transform the existing non-ideal state into the ideal is what may ultimately be the source of all problems, as we have no information as to how this transformation should occur, and also have not taken into account the reasons why the current state happens to be non-ideal in the first place (other than random chance).

There is another doubt I had regarding the manner in which we should interpret this regulation of art and literature. The way it is presented, is supposed to be for the purposes of providing the correct education for the guardians. Does this mean that the entire art and literature for the society should be molded into a certain manner so as to ensure the appropriate education for just the guardian class, or is it that only the literature and art that the guardians are _exposed to_ should be of such nature, and otherwise the restrictions don't hold on the remaining society? The former seems too stringent, and the latter seems very impractical - as in, how do you ensure that there is no exposure at all? Especially considering that you don't even know who becomes a guardian at birth, you have to determine that from their aptitude over childhood.

One last thought (I actually got this thought, not by myself, but from listening to someone's argument from today's class discussion, and I find this to be quite important, and so I'm including it as well), Socrates describes the importance of various kinds of virtuous qualities required in guardians throughout the dialogue, for them to be good at their job. But it is never explained how those specific qualities are really helpful (or even how to define those qualities). This seems to be a crucial assumption, since by their nature, these qualities have moral value, and may thus have a direct relation with our understanding of justice (which is supposedly the point of the entire discourse).

## Book 4

**General overview**

Book 4 ends the discussing on the structure and features of the ideal state, and enters the key discussion on the nature of justice and injustice (for which, this entire elaborate abstract setup of the "ideal state" was conjured up in the first place).

I shall mention some key points from this book, first on the final discussion surrounding the ideal state, and then on the question of justice and injustice. After this, I felt like it would be a good idea to build up a very brief roadmap of the entire "argument for justice" Socrates gave, starting from Book 2 till now, to have a good sense of the architecture of the argument, and to understand the progress made.

**Final discussions on the construction of the ideal state**

- **419 -- (Community vs Individual happiness) -- :** Adeimantus has a good criticism of the ideal state, questioning the status of individual happiness. Socrates gives a less satisfactory explanation, essentially favoring the community happiness over individual happiness, in order to ensure proper functioning of all classes in the state. However, the problem of "aspirations" (i.e., motivation to progress in life, and to make one's life meaningful) with regards to the individuals is supposedly ignored, and rather seems to be considered an ill. But if individuals are stuck in a rigid system, where the system and their innate abilities (which are beyond their control) dictate their life, doesn't that lack of freedom potentially lead to problems? Perhaps Socrates would consider that in the truly ideal state, things would occur in such a way (through education, and legislation) that the people in Society will accept their roles as they are. Though it seems that that would either require complete mind-control, or a society where people are punished criminally for acting otherwise, and the others fearfully hide such aspirations in their minds. This brings up the question perhaps: is freedom of doing what you want and thinking what you want worth so much that it matters more than an otherwise "perfect" stagnant state where everything functions well but people just "live" and that's all?
- **421d - 423c -- (Problem with wealth and poverty + Importance of unity) -- :** Wealth and poverty are regarded as harmful to the society, as both would not allow the people within their respective classes to continue their proper functions. This might be regarded as a criticism of economic inequality (although, in real life it seems that people who are very rich don't necessarily always stop working, which seems contradictory to what Socrates assumes). However, the complete abolition of wealth itself seems to be a rather dangerous step, along the same lines of reasoning as previously discussed, with regards to the fact that money is what not just motivates further effort and hard-work, but also fuels further massive endeavors of ambitious individuals in a society who want to progress ahead and make accomplishments. But it is understandable that in the ideal state, since people anyways are supposed to just spend their life doing one job, this might not matter anyways.  
    <br/>In addition to this, he also discusses the importance of unity, and that the state should continue its growth, only as long as this unity among all the classes is maintained.
- **423e - 424b -- (On the education system) -- :** He says that the education system will by itself act as a positive feedback loop, i.e., it will produce good individuals, who will have good children who will further become better individuals through education and have better children, and so on. The importance of the education system is considered so much that it is meant to be absolutely unchangeable.
- **425e -- (On legislation) -- :** He says that they need not think about legislation, since good individuals that are produced in such a society though good education will themselves figure that out. However, strangely, he deviates from this once, in **427b,c** , where he doesn't trust future generations with the ability to interpret the traditional wisdom surrounding the founding of temples and performing religious rites and sacrifices; which is a very interesting self-contradiction.

**On the nature of justice and injustice**

- **427e :** The ideal state is said to have wisdom, courage, self-discipline and justice. Socrates presents the proposition that by finding out what the other three are, we can figure out what the remainder, i.e. justice, is. This idea is not very technically clear though, since it assumes that only these four properties exist in the ideal state (otherwise, if there were others as well, then how could we know that the remainder arrived at after excluding the three is justice only?)
- **433a,b -- (Definition of justice in the state) -- :** Justice in the state is defined as "minding one's own business and not interfering with other people". Their is one confusion on how to interpret "...not interfering with other people" as in the literal sense this runs into the contradiction that the rulers' job necessarily involves interfering with others. So maybe the correct interpretation is that "one should not take up the job that is supposed to be that of other people"?  
    With regards to this definition, there is also an interesting thought I had, that was inspired by a conversation I had with Gurniwaz: If this would have been the definition proposed by some character (say Polemarchus or Thrasymachus) in Book 1, how would Socrates himself respond to it!? (Would he accept it as it is, or would he act, as he naturally does, to concoct an argument to bring to light a flaw in this definition!?)
- **434c :** He appears to have assumed here in advance that injustice is immoral, in order to arrive at the definition of injustice.
- **434e onwards -- (City-Soul analogy) -- :** Justice in the individual is said to be understood by examining justice in the city. In fact, an even deeper analogy between the city and the individual soul is drawn, by comparing the three parts of the state (wise rulers, courageous auxiliaries, and self-discipline) with an analogous three parts in the soul of an individual.
- **435b - 441c** : Arrives at the idea of the three parts of the soul - namely the rational part, the spirit, and the irrational appetite.
- **442d** : Self-discipline, both in the state and the individual, is when the three parts know their roles and perform them in harmonious agreement.
- **443a,b :** Claim that a just man, in the sense as defined, would not perform any wrong action.
- **444c-e :** Analogy of justice with health, and injustice with defect/disease.
- **445a - 449a** : Socrates says that they must still continue with their argumentation, to show that justice pays better than injustice. He starts with an analogy by comparing different characters that an individual may have with the different kinds of political constitutions (which he says, are of five types). The first type - i.e., either Monarchy or Aristocracy - which exists in their ideal state, is the best kind, and he associates that with good health.  
    The line of reasoning, however, gets interrupted here (and is continued much later ahead, in Book 8), as shall be seen in the very beginning of Book 5.

**Broad Architecture of Socrates' Argument to Arrive at the Definition of Justice (Book II - IV)**

Now that we have been through the entire construction of Socrates' argument, here is a very broad overview of its structure, as a summary:

1. Justice in the state is easier to examine than in a single individual, if we are to understand justice properly.
2. Construction of the ideal state begins: Has people following the principle of specialization.
    1. In order to go beyond basic necessities of people, the state will expand, and need of security to defend against such foreign states will arise - thus, Guardian class is required. These guardians need to be wise.
    2. Removal of the kinds of art, literature, music and other education that would hinder the development of ideal educated Guardians. Prohibition of guardians to possess any private property.
    3. Guardian class in subdivided into two classes - Rulers and Auxiliaries.
    4. Creation of a myth, and instill its belief in the citizens, to ensure they harmoniously perform their functions.
    5. Removal of wealth and poverty, which are hindrances to the unity of the state.
    6. An ideal unchangeable education system that improves the quality of individuals over successive generations.
3. Justice in the state is essentially defined from the principle of specialization: "One must mind their own business, and not interfere with others."
4. The city-soul analogy is invoked to suggest that since the city has three parts (wisdom, courage and self-discipline / self-preservation), thus the soul must also - these are obtained as, the rational, the spirit, and the irrational appetite parts.
5. By analogy with the state, justice in the individual is the three parts of the soul knowing their true functions and working together harmoniously.
6. It is claimed that such a state or an individual would never commit any wrong act. Thus, a just state / just man would only perform good actions.

## Book 5

**Overview**

The discussion in Book 5 can be divided into three main parts:

1. The role of women, children and family (with discussions on broader community)
2. The rules of war
3. The practicability of the state (with discussions on knowledge and philosophy)

The interesting (and important) ideas discussed in each of these parts are mentioned below.

**The Role of Women and Children -- & -- Discussions on Community**

- **451e -- (Feminist-like equality of opportunity between men and women) -- :** Women are to be treated equally, and may also be guardians, although it is recognized that they are physically weaker than men.
- **452b -- (Feminist-like desexualization of nudity) :** Women must (like men) exercise naked in the gymnasium. Here, there is even a recognition that this appears funny, but it is claimed that this is only due to an arbitrary social norm, which would change over time. This idea is quite interesting, and complex, and even exists as a debate in modern times, to understand whether the legal (or even moral) requirement for covering up of sexual body parts of women and men really has any good justification.
- **454a :** Makes a point that often in debates people simply engage in "scoring points" rather than making good reasonable arguments.
- **454b-e :** Clarification made that when we say "different natures should have different jobs", 'different natures' refers to specifically those qualifications that are relevant to the employment.
- **455d,e :** A fallacy seems to be made here - men are in general said to be better at _everything_ than women (even though in individual cases, women can be better than men). However it is known that there are specific examples of jobs where women on average would perform better (for instance, roles involving requirements that may favor personality traits higher in agreeableness (such as perhaps, social work, counseling, nursing, etc.), which women are higher in on average as per psychological research).
- **457d -- (Communitarian/collectivist social organization) -- :** Men and women can't live together in separate households. All women should be common to all men. All children should be held in common and no parent should know its child. This is almost a Marxist treatment of the guardian society, in the sense of complete abolishment of anything that can be associated with "private property", or its extension to anything personal/private in general.
- **458d - 459a -- (Eugenic regulation of sex) -- :** Sexual partners cannot be a personal choice, and must be regulated by rulers, so as to produce the best results for society. This is obviously a blatantly eugenic idea, and the extent to which the communitarian ideology must be imposed, at the expense of what we would regard as basic morality, is becoming increasingly clear.
- **459d - 460b :** Using myth and deceit so that guardians don't know that the selection of partners is being planned by the rulers themselves. Despite the obvious moral qualms here - is this really a sustainable strategy?
- **460c -- (Eugenic breeding of children) -- :** Defective children / children of inferior guardians are to be secretly "disposed off".
- **460e - 461e -- (Regulation of mating age and incest) -- :** The prime age ranges for mating for both men and women are mentioned.  
    Also, it is mentioned that people can't mate with their close family relations (i.e., descendants or forebears), however, brother and sisters are allowed to mate (which is a strange exception). The reasons for this rule on mating between family relations are not really given.
- **463e - 464a -- (Communistic alignment of human behavior with collective interest) -- :** People will treat each others' successes/failures as their own, and will share their emotions. This is a very communist-like notion of expecting citizens to be devoted to the common interest to the individual behavioral level itself.
- **464e -- (Conflict elimination through lack of private property) -- :** Claim that having no private property/possessions (and everything else being in common) will eliminate quarrels and conflict among them. Perhaps to some extent that may be true, but it seems to completely disregard the increasing possibility of psychological and existential conflict to arise in place of this.
- **464e - 465a :** People can defend themselves against others of the same age; but must respect elders.
- **466a-c -- (Anti-capitalistic notion of happiness) -- :** Idea that even though the people will own nothing, they would be satisfied, as they lead a better life, and it would thus be unwise to pursue individual happiness. This is again a strongly anti-materialistic and anti-capitalistic idea, in support of a communistic collective-happiness. Again, the argument for this massive and radical claim does not appear to be strong enough.

**The Rules of War**

- **467a-e :** Children should be taken to war, so they can see and learn the skills. This risk is said to be worth it.
- **468a -- (Treatment of prisoners) -- :** Any of "them" taken prisoner should be abandoned to the captors to deal with them as they wish. Here, I am not sure who "them" refers to - our soldiers, or the enemy? Either way, the morality of treatment of prisoners (as reflected in "...to deal with them as they wish") is quite questionable.
- **468c :** Very strange rule of being forced to kiss the brave/distinguished soldiers.
- **469c :** Greeks should not sell Greeks into slavery, and should instead spare them.
- **469d,e -- (Respecting enemy corpses) -- :** Plundering/stripping enemy corpses is deemed as low and mean, and to be disallowed. Also, burial should not be refused.
- **470d,e :** Distinction between "war" and "civil strife" is made.

**Practicability of the state -- & -- Discussion on Philosophy**

- **472c-e :** Acknowledgment that we will be satisfied by only closely approximating to the ideal in practice (although, it is not clarified what "close" here truly means, or how we could determine it).
- **473b-e -- (The idea of "philosopher-rulers" as the necessary and sufficient change) -- :** Strong claim made that the transformation from the existing state constitution to the approximately ideal state can be made through just a single change (and this is not only sufficient, but is also necessary) - that being, 'the philosophers must become rulers or the rulers must become philosophers'. It is also acknowledged in the discussion at this point that this is a very radical idea.
- **474c - 475b :** A philosopher must have a passion/love for every kind of knowledge.
- **477a :** Claim made that one cannot know "something that is not". Here I am slightly confused by what "is not" is supposed to mean. Is it in the sense of "not existing" or of "not being true" (because the latter can be known - for instance, one knows that a bachelor _is not_ married).
- **476e - 478d -- (Knowledge, ignorance and opinion) -- :** Knowledge is related to "what is", and ignorance is related to "what is not". Opinion is intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, but it also must be related to "what is" in some manner.
- **478e - 480a -- (Definition of philosopher) -- :** Distinction between people with hearts in the field of opinion (i.e., those fluctuating between "being" and "not being") and those with hearts in the field of knowledge (i.e., those who have eyes on the eternal unchanging things). Philosophers are defined as those people, who not only have a passion for all knowledge, but who also have their hearts fixed on the true being of each thing (and not mere lovers of opinion). I found this to be quite an intriguing way of defining the idea of a philosopher, and I myself would perhaps have come up with a similar kind of definition.

## Book 6

**Overview**

Book 6 appears to delve into a wide variety of issues, even though in the first half of it it might appear to be relatively similar in style to the previous books. The first half continues the discussion on the concept of a "philosopher-ruler", now taken more seriously, but it is followed in the second half by a very elaborate epistemological investigation into the notions of knowledge and opinion, when trying to uncover the education necessary for philosophers.

For making notes, I have thus classified Book 6 as follows:

Part I : On the philosopher-ruler

1. Qualities of philosophers
2. Why philosophers are often useless or dangerous
3. The philosopher-ruler is not impossible

Part II : On philosophical education and epistemology

1. On the education of the philosopher
2. Simile of the Sun
3. The Divided Line

**\---------------------------- Part I : On the philosopher-ruler ----------------------------**

**Qualities of philosophers**

- **484b - 485a :** Philosophers are those who grasp the eternal and immutable. Here it is pointed out that for being rulers they must show that in addition to knowledge of the true reality, philosophers also have excellence in all human departments (i.e., practical experience) as required for guardians.  
    **_Thought:_** _Does this not go against the principle of specialization?_
- **485b-d :** Philosopher has a love of learning, and thus a love for the whole of reality. So he must be truthful, since truth is the most closely connected thing to wisdom (and, love of wisdom and the love of falsehood cannot exist together).
- **485d :** If one's desires flow towards a love of knowledge, the love of other pleasures will be reduced.  
    **_Thought_**_: Is this really necessarily true?_
- **486a :** A man with such greatness of mind will not regard human life as a thing of great consequence.  
    **_Thought_**_: I found this to be a very interesting take, since I did not expect Socrates to take this relatively modern view similar to the one where we don't treat human beings as being excessively special, under a scientific understanding that they too are just one kind of living species on the planet._
- **486b :** The philosopher will not regard death as being something to be afraid of.  
    **_Thought_**_: This implication seems to be somewhat fallacious. Does life not allow one to pursue philosophical understanding? So then life is the minimum necessity for that, and if philosophical understanding of the world matters to any extent, then at life would also matter and have value, at least in this instrumental sense, as a means of achieving that._
- **486b - 487a :** The qualities of a philosopher are considered as - good memory, readiness to learn, breath of vision and grace (i.e., sense of proportionality), truthfulness, justice, courage and self-control.

**Why philosophers are often useless or dangerous**

- **487b,c :** Adeimantus makes a good point on the issue that people may have with Socrates' style of argumentation. I also agree with this to a large extent.
- **487c-e :** Adeimantus argues that philosophers are commonly regarded as either useless or vicious.
- **488b-e --- (Attitude of society towards philosophers) --- :** Socrates draws an analogy of a ship crew.  
    Captain ---> Existing imperfect ruler  
    Crew ---> People in the society arguing about who would be the correct ruler, and claim that their is no skill of ruling; there is a power struggle between different factions, trying to kill one another to themselves gain power. _(_**_Thought:_** _Since no "metric" of good ruling is considered to exist, the only thing that matters is who can grab the status of ruler through exercise of power.)  
    _True navigator ---> Philosopher, who has actual skill and knowledge, but the crew/people will recognize him as a useless "word-spinner".
- **489b,c :** It is the "natural order" for those in need of direction to "wait" for the philosopher to give it to him.  
    **_Thought_**_: This seems somewhat narcissistic though (and impractical), i.e., to expect all of society to "wait" for certain people to give their judgments. In reality things are more complex, and direction might not be waited for easily. Additionally, if philosophers (or anyone for that matter) are to give their judgments, they cannot expect anyone to wait for them. One must speak up themselves, and it is largely your own responsibility to prove the worth of your speech._
- **491b,c :** Socrates admits that the qualities required for the ideal philosopher would occur seldomly in man. In fact he makes a strange claim after this - that the qualities (courage, self discipline, etc.), as well as all good things in life (good looks, wealth, physical strength, social and familial connection, etc.), actually distract from philosophy, even though they are necessary to be an ideal philosopher.
- **491d,e :** Makes the following argument:  
    \- Any seed/growth needs the right nourishment and environment.  
    \- Bad environment affects good quality more than it would affect something already of bad quality.  
    \- Thus, gifted characters in poor environment get ruined.
- **492a-d :** Philosophers are not corrupted by individual sophists, but rather by people/crowd who all act like sophists by going along with approval or disapproval of whatever they consider as popular ideas of what is right or wrong, which corrupts the minds of the young. Additionally, punishments given to people who disagree are also an influencing factor.  
    **_Thought_**_: I felt that this is a very interesting point, since each of us lives in society, where people around us, friends and family, often hold certain opinions, and they make independent thought more of a difficulty, especially if not exposed to a diversity of opinions._
- **493a-e :** Individual sophists are considered as just those people who teach conventional views in the name of science. They make the mistake of making the public their master and requiring their approval, which does not guarantee merit.  
    **_Thought_**_: I found this to be very true, and a very fascinating point, since it is largely true that almost all teachers we encounter, even if they are very knowledgeable or skilled at teaching, are bound by a kind of "syllabus" or set of items they are "supposed" to teach, and teaching is more about dispersing conventionally known knowledge rather than engaging in a discussion on difficult topics that have not yet been established or understood well._
- **494a :** **_Thought:_** _Seems to make a rather too strong a claim that philosophy is impossible among the common people, and so they must disapprove of philosophers._
- **494b-e --- (How the qualities themselves hinder the philosopher) --- :** A philosophically minded person (and one with the required qualities) in such an environment will get full of pride and ambition, and will not understand someone who tries to give him good advice on his errors. His friends and others will try to use him for their own gains. In this way, the qualities themselves hinder him from becoming a true philosopher.
- **496b-e :** The true philosopher could only come about in a state where he is brought up outside of all these influences, and somehow turns to philosophy and finds happiness in it. He would then realize that there is no value in politics and no good will be gained from it, and he will thus keep to himself and away from all wrongdoing.  
    **_Thought_**_: But if he would find no value in politics, then how and why would a philosopher-ruler come about?_

**The philosopher-ruler is not impossible**

- **497b-c :** No existing society suits the philosophic nature, and the necessary state is the ideal state.
- **498b,c --- (On the right training for philosophers) --- :** The training for philosophers is:  
    \- At a young age, only a small amount of philosophic training.  
    \- Should give attention to their body.  
    \- As they mature, mental training can be intensified.  
    \- When they get old, they're no longer fit for political/military service, and should devote all their time to philosophy.
- **499b-d :** The non-corrupt philosophers need to be compelled and forced to take part in politics.  
    **_Thought:_** _Is this an ideal approach? If the philosopher-ruler is truly the one who has the best rational faculty, and has an understanding of the ultimate reality, then we would expect that he understands the reasoning behind why philosopher-ruler are the best rulers, and why they ought to rule. If he is truly harmonious and just in character, i.e., his reason is able to take charge over any intrinsic desires or emotions, then he should take decisions in accordance with reason. Then he should come to the conclusion that he must rule, and should not need to be compelled through any other means. Why should he be reluctant to rule in any way?_
- **500a : _Thought_**_: Earlier (at 494a) Socrates said that philosophy is impossible among common men. But here he seems to contradict himself by suggesting that the majority of people could be persuaded._
- **500d,e :** Philosopher deals with the divine order, and thus has characteristics of order and divinity. He will also be capable of instilling these qualities in others.  
    **_Thought:_** _The term "divine" pattern seems to be referring to an understanding of the immutable reality (if I am not wrong?). Why is "divine" used here? Is that how the word is meant to be defined? It appears like something that should be clarified, since it can be misinterpreted (assuming this is not the intended interpretation itself!) as philosophers having some connection to the supernatural. (Or if this is the intended interpretation, then does that mean Socrates considers the immutable reality as something "supernatural"?)_
- **501a --- (Social reconstruction of human society) --- :** Idea that the slate of human society should be "wiped clean", and a new social system should be drawn.  
    **_Thought:_** _This idea seems quite radical, and apparently disregards any value in the existing system at all. Can't an examination be done to find out whether some of the existing social structure has good reason for existing? What about human nature? Is that not something that might impose limits on what shape the social structures could practically take? (The "Blank Slate" view is already understood to be false in the absolute sense, as discussed in the works of psychologists such as Steven Pinker)._
- **501b :** Will go on until he has made human nature acceptable to God.  
    **_Thought:_** _Why acceptable to "God"? God was not really invoked in any argument prior to this, so that appears to be a significant difference. Is "God", here, a personification of the philosophic virtues?_
- **502b :** Once one such ideal ruler comes about and demonstrates their virtue, all doubts will be put to rest.

**\-------------------- Part II : On philosophical education and epistemology ----------------------**

**On the education of the philosopher**

- **503b :** Socrates admits that the guardians must be philosophers.
- **503c,d :** Guardians must have all these multiple qualities.  
    **_Thought:_** _As also mentioned previously, does this not go against the principle of specialization?_
- **504a :** They must be tested (in addition to previously discussed tests) on intellectual studies, to see if they have the endurance necessary to pursue the "highest forms of knowledge".
- **504d :** The "highest form of knowledge" is something even higher than justice (and the other qualities).
- **505a,b --- (The highest form of knowledge) --- :** The highest form of knowledge is "knowledge of the form of the good", and from this things that are just and so on can be derived. Also, it is claimed that without this knowledge, all other forms of knowledge are of no use.  
    **_Thought:_** _I found this to be an extremely significant, strong, and interesting claim._
- **505b :** Common people consider pleasure as good (i.e., common people are hedonistic), whereas sophisticated ones think knowledge is good. But here, when "knowledge" is specified as "knowledge of the good", in a cyclical sense, Socrates admits the absurdity of it.
- **505c :** There are both good and bad pleasures; so if good is defined as pleasure, and then some pleasures are called bad, this leads to an obvious confusion.
- **505d :** Recognizes people often prefer appearances of justice/value to reality; but they are not satisfied just by appearance, and want something that "really is".
- **505e --- (Good as the ultimate object of desire) --- :** "Good is that which is the end of all endeavour - i.e., the ultimate object of desire (even if one may not be aware of what exactly it is).  
    **_Thought:_** _Once again, I found this claim to be very spectacular and interesting in nature. It seems to be something into which a lot of further analyses can be made._
- **506a,b :** A guardian can only be useful if he has a knowledge of goodness.
- **506e :** Socrates admits that an understanding of what "good" is in itself is beyond the range of their present inquiry. Instead he says they can discuss a "child of the good".  
    **_Thought_**_: This seems to be one of the very rare instances (if not only instance yet) where Socrates very explicitly states that a topic is beyond the scope of the discussion!_

**Simile of the Sun**

- **507b --- (The theory of forms | Intelligible vs visual realms) --- :** Distinguishes particulars from forms. Forms are objects of intelligence, but not of sight.
- **507d - 508a : _Thought:_** _The idea that sight requires light is okay; but this is not really as unique to sight as Socrates makes it out to be! For instance:  
    __Ears ---> need air as a medium for sound to be audible  
    __Smell ---> requires for the molecules to travel from the object to the nose_
- **508c --- (Simile of the Sun) --- :** Presents an analogy (technically, a simile):  
    Just like the Sun allows for sight, and thus has a relation with sight and visible objects in the visible realm  
    \---- SIMILARLY ----  
    The "good" allows "intelligence", and has a relation with "intelligence" and intelligible objects in the intelligible realm.
- **508c,d :** Presents the analogy:  
    Sun is the source of light, which shines on objects to make them visible and clear  
    \---- SIMILARLY ----  
    Goodness is the source of truth and reality, which illuminates intelligible objects and allows intelligence to exist  
    The opposite analogy is:  
    Objects are dimly lit and not clear  
    \---- SIMILARLY ----  
    Vision is confused and comprised of shifting opinions.
- **509a --- (Good is ranked above knowledge and truth) --- :** Presents the analogy:  
    Just like the sun can be seen with light, but is not light itself, instead it is the source of light  
    \---- SIMILARLY ----  
    The form of the good can be known, but it is not some knowledge or truth itself, instead it is the source of knowledge and truth (i.e., it is what gives objects of knowledge their truth)
- **509b:** Presents the analogy:  
    Sun causes the processes of growth and generation. However it is not itself a process.  
    \---- SIMILARLY ----  
    The good is not only the source of intelligibility and knowledge, but also the source of their being and reality. However it is not itself that reality (instead it is a reality beyond it).  
    **_Thought:_** _This idea of a kind of transcendental reality existing separately from the ordinary "physical" (visual) reality is very surprising to me, since I did not expect to see a mention of it in the works on Plato! It would be very interesting to get to explore some of the metaphysical ideas Plato has, regarding what "real" means, and so on, if that were possible!_

**The Divided Line**

**509d - 511e :** The visible world is not only used as an analogy for the intelligible realm (as in the Simile of the Sun), but here, Socrates gives a hierarchical arrangement and classification of both realms.

There is a hierarchy of the form (A) > (B) > (C) > (D), expressed below, along with what the different subcategories consist of:

1. **Intelligible realm**
    1. _Intelligence (A) - (associated with knowledge) -_ Using assumptions as first principles, and through them alone, arriving at conclusions; i.e., going from forms to forms through forms. For example: Dialectic.
    2. _Reason (B) - (considered between knowledge and opinion) -_ Using assumptions, but not as first principles; additionally, making use of images of real objects, to arrive at conclusions. For example: Geometry.
2. **Visual realm - (associated with opinion)**
    1. _Belief (C) -_ Real objects themselves. For example: plants, animals, etc.
    2. _Illusion (D) -_ Images of real objects. For example: shadows, reflections, illustrations, etc.

## Book 7

**Overview**

Book 7 begins with the simile of the cave (which is in continuation of the discussion of the similes of the sun, and the divided line, which were covered in Book 6), and goes on in an extensive conversation on the education of the philosopher.

**The Simile of the Cave**

- **514a - 515e :** People in the cave are shackled in chains and imprisoned to the extent that they cannot even turn their heads. Puppets are being shown by men and they are also talking, but the chained people can only see the shadows of these objects, and listen to the sounds that are reflected from the walls of the cave. For these chained people this is the reality the believe, since they have no other experience. They consider the shadows to be real, and the voices to be coming from them. But if these people are released and brought near the light of the fire, they will be able to see the real objects whose shadows were being cast; at this sight their eyes will be dazzled due to the sudden brightness, and it will be hard for them to look, and they will try to resist accepting these object as more real than the shadows.  
    **_Thought:_** _This is quite an interesting manner of metaphorically representing the idea that people holding deluded beliefs can find it very difficult to recognize and accept the reality when it is actually presented before them._
- **516a-e :** If the person is still forced out of the cave into the sunlight, he will at first be dazzled by the immense brightness, but would gradually recognize the various objects of the Earth, and the sun and the night-sky, after which he shall gain an understanding of the true reality. He would consider the various practices and beliefs they held previously inside the cave as being entirely pointless.  
    **_Thought:_** _This is a good representation of the idea that once knowledge of reality is gained, then the previous beliefs and practices appear to be obviously irrational and pointless in nature. This may be related with the experience many people have when they look at religious practices, and realize that people are holding a false conception of reality, and are taking part in rituals that hold no real purpose._
- **516e - 517a :** The person, if he would go back into the darkness, would find it difficult to see inside. This would make the people in the cave ridicule him for going out of the cave, and they would not allow anyone else to leave, for fear of losing what they consider to be _their_ understanding of reality.  
    **_Thought:_** _Again, this seems to have a very close similarity to the way religious people react to ordinary, rational questions and arguments, by behaving emotionally, and acting out a strong irrational attachment to a belief system. But of course, this analogy can be applied even beyond religion, to more general false beliefs people hold, where they reject the rational approach and take an emotion driven "belief"-based approach._
- **517b,c :** The cave is compared with the visual realm; the shadows are the illusion, and the sight of real objects with the help of the fire is related with belief. The realm outside the cave, into the sunshine, is compared with the intelligible realm, with the ascent towards the sun representing an ascent towards the form of the good.
- **518a,b :** The people coming from the brightness and being confused when they see the darkness should be congratulated; but the ones in the cave that are dazzled by the brightness should be sympathized with.
- **518c-e :** The capacity for knowledge is innate, and we only need to turn our mind's eye towards the good to be able to gain this knowledge. This turning of the mind is a skill that needs to be learnt - it does not imbibe any "sight" (since that is already innate), but instead it gives the "direction". Other skills need to be trained for, and they are not innate.
- **519a - 520e :** Bad but clever people are those with "sight" but with the wrong direction - they are turned towards evil instead of good. It is thus necessary to educate people to help them see truth and reality, and thus the philosophers (who are the best minds) must be compelled to take up the duty of rulers, by being forced back into the cave and help the orient the rest of the people towards the good (i.e., the highest form of knowledge). They may want to remain outside the cave, but shall be convinced of their duty through the reasoning that it will serve the greater good (and the common good ranks above individual good) - so, being just men, they will accept this duty.  
    **_Thought:_** _Keeping aside the standard questions of common vs individual good, and individual freedom, we could still ask a logical question in this scenario - why do the philosophers need to descend down into the cave, and why cannot instead all people be brought outside the cave? Socrates seems to have not brought this question into the discussion at all, and it has been assumed implicitly that only the philosopher class shall be brought out. One reasoning I could think of for this is that the philosophers are the ones with the greatest rational capacity in the entire population. The others also have their reason in harmony with the appetite and spirit, but their reason is of lower capacity in relative terms, and thus even if they were to be brought out towards the true reality directly, they shall gain only an "incomplete" understanding of it. So, if the goal is to gain an understanding of the true reality up to the greatest extent for the greatest number of people, then it might be considered better to have the philosophers convey the knowledge (which is "perfect" in understanding) to the rest of the people, rather than have them try to realize it for themselves imperfectly.__This idea is pretty complex in itself, and could be further debated on quite extensively._
- **521a,b :** Socrates solidifies the point that the only people who should have political power should be those who do not love it, and since he considers philosophers the only people who fall into this category, they are the class of people who need to be rulers.

**Education of the philosopher**

- **521c,d :** Education has the goal of producing philosophers who can see the true reality. Since they will also be involved in matters of war, this knowledge must be relevant to war as well.
- **521e - 523a :** This study cannot be found in either physical training, or in music or literature, since all of them deal with change / "becoming" / the visual realm. One of such studies may instead be something common to all practical, intellectual and scientific occupations - and this is considered to be numbers and counting. This is one such subject that draws the mind to thought.
- **523a - 524d :** Makes the distinction between two kinds of perceptions - (i) where there is only one sensation, and so the mind does not need to be brought to thought, and (ii) where there are two contrary perceptions / sensations, and thus the mind is drawn to thought to reason between them. The emphasis on reasoning is made here, since direct sensations are associated with the visual realm, and the subjects that involve the mind being drawn to thought involve the intelligible realm.
- **524e - 531c -- (Five mathematical studies) -- :** Since mathematics has the characteristic that it draws the mind to thought, subjects involving it are discussed:
  - **Arithmetic:** Unity can be considered as one, and also as a plurality (by asking what is unity in itself), and so it draws the mind to thought. Also, those who are good at this are found to be quick and better at learning other kinds of work as well.
  - **Plane Geometry:** Knowledge of geometry is useful in war (for instance, positioning the army, etc.). But the typical practice of it "doing" rather than "reasoning", and the later is emphasized as being what should be given focus to for gaining knowledge.
  - **Solid Geometry:** Involves the study of solid bodies themselves (rather than astronomy, where moving solid bodies are studied). Even thought, at that time, not much was explored in this subject, Socrates considered it important for the purpose of acquiring knowledge.
  - **Astronomy:** The reasoning and rational thought regarding positions and velocities is useful for improving the mind, but looking at the sky and the objects themselves is not considered to hold much value. That is treated as only a visual illustration.
  - **Harmonics:** Just like astronomy is the study of physical motion of bodies, harmonics is the study of the "movements" of sound/harmony. However, just like for astronomy, emphasis on knowledge is to be given rather than on the sounds or instruments themselves.  
        <br/>**_Thought:_** _The idea the mathematics is in itself a perfect unchanging reality, and thus "beyond" the mere "physical world" is an interesting one, but I am not sure whether that is true. If we consider mathematics as a system, it can essentially be broken into two parts - (i) axioms (assumptions that cannot be proven within the system itself), and (ii) logical reasoning - and through an application of logic to the axioms, we can derive further mathematical facts (called "theorems"). Clearly, the problem is, there is no basis within the system of mathematics itself to justify why these specific axioms have been chosen. We could, in principle, take an alternate set of axioms, and construct logically a completely different "mathematics" out of it. Also, there is the question of whether logic has any basis to it? This is an even deeper philosophical problem of course. But even if we just consider the problem of axiomatic choice, it is clear that there are multiple (if not infinite) versions of mathematics, none being better than the other in any logical sense. The only interesting feature of "our" version of mathematics is that it appears to have a very extensive utility to describe patterns and objects of the physical world - but this too is not a coincidence, since historically the creation of mathematical ideas has been largely driven by the desire to solve physical problems. So this begs the question - is mathematics really "beyond reality", or is it that reality came first, and mathematics as we know it has only been chosen in accordance with it (in which case, reality would rank above mathematics in a certain sense). However, there is the challenge of what we mean by "mathematics" itself. If we refer to it as "our" version of mathematics, then this problem of mathematics being a selection based on reality does exist; but if we consider the abstract concept of systems that are logically coherent and consisting at their base any axiomatic set of assumptions, and call all these systems "mathematics", then we must ask the question of logic that we left behind. Is logic something that precedes reality? Or is reality all-encompassing to the extent that even logic itself only exists in reality, and so reality precedes it? That would get into a highly metaphysical domain of debate of course._
- **531e - 534e -- (On Dialectic) -- :** Dialectic is considered to be the ultimate intellectual study, being associated directly with intelligence (A), whereas the mathematical studies were associated with reason (B). Dialectic involves the knowledge of things in themselves. A person who is a true philosopher (and thus also a dialectician) would have an understanding of the form of the good with complete clarity. The study of dialectics is unique in the sense that it is the only one of its kind which proceeds to destroy assumptions to their very first principle, whereas all other studies start out with assumptions and move ahead with them.
- **535a - 540b -- (Selection and Curriculum) -- :** Here, a final discussion of the procedure for education is discussed. This is described as follows:
  - People with natural qualities and aptitudes are to be selected. People with good qualities are necessary to prevent unworthy people from becoming philosophers, and thus to avoid exacerbating the existing problem of the bad name that philosophy gets from them.
  - 2 years of physical and military training (from age 18 - 20 years).
  - Mathematical and dialectic studies are to be taught in schools (between ages 20 - 30 years for mathematical studies, and 5 years after that for dialectics) - however not with compulsion, but rather with an element of play, since compulsory learning does not stick to the mind.  
        **_Thought:_** _This idea was very surprising to me, since I did not expect Socrates to actually consider it!_
  - The teaching of dialectic is to be done cautiously, as if done in a too early stage, it may get misaligned and children can take up random argumentation just for the sake of argumentation, rather than the correct goal - which is to arrive at the truth. Through this they may even lose respect for truth and reality itself, by coming to the conclusion that nothing they previously believed is actually true - which would be a disservice to all philosophy.
  - Finally, there shall be 15 years of practical experience in offices, after which they will have enough knowledge and experience to be rulers and run society in the best manner possible.
- **540c :** Women can also be rulers, and everything discussed till now applies equally to women, as long as they share the required aptitudes and qualities.
- **541a :** All citizens above the age of 10 years are to be sent into the country, away from the influence of their parents, so that they can learn their own ways of living and thinking.  
    **_Thought:_** _Psychologically, is this an approach that would be viable (in terms of the mental health of the children)?_

This ends the discussion of the ideal society and how it shall come about, and what the nature of the ideal person living in such a society would be.

## Book 8

**Overview**

Book 8 starts out with a continuation of the discussion that was left behind at the end of Book 4. Just to keep track of the overall structure of The Republic till now, we can see the flow of topics as follows:

Book I (Raising the question of justice)

|

Book II (Restating of the problem of justice)

|

Book II - IV (Constructing the ideal state)

\--> City-Soul analogy

\--> Raising question of injustice giving bad outcomes

\--> Relating unjust individuals with the corresponding unjust societies (i.e. imperfect societies)

|

|---- Deflection of discussion --> Role of Women (Book V)

| --> Philosopher ruler (Book VI - VII)

Book VIII (Imperfect societies)

**Notes on Book VIII**

Here in Book 8, four kinds of imperfect societies are mentioned, which are explained as a downward progression from the ideal state. These are:

Ideal state --> Timarchy --> Oligarchy --> Democracy --> Tyranny

|\_**\_**\_**\_**\_Imperfect states_\_**\_**\_**\_**\__|

The four imperfect societies (and the corresponding individual characters) are:

1. **Timarchy (545d - 550c)**
    - **_Thought:_** _In 546a, Socrates mentions a very interesting point that "all created things must decay", and so the social order of the ideal state will also fall. This is a very valid point, which in fact is partly a critique that one would place against his ideal state - making it interesting since it seems that he is also well aware of this problem._
    - The ruling class in the ideal state would engage in civil strife with one another.
    - They pull in opposite directions, and ultimately move towards private ownership and profit.
    - The rest of the population, who were the subjects, now are in subjugation.
    - Admittance of intelligent and good people to ruling class would be feared and avoided.
    - War would be preferable to peace.
    - Money will be given importance, but not openly.
    - **Timarchic character:** He sees the lower social status of his good father, and also learns of the problems of lack of money, and thus grows to become competitive, ambitious and energetic, and is good at heart, though he falls into bad company.
    - **_Thought:_** _The point at 549d seemed quite thought provoking, since I feel that it is true in the real world currently too, where the importance of status makes people feel that being a "good" or "nice" person is 'unfortunately' not useful in society if one wants to be successful._
2. **Oligarchy (550d - 555b)**
    - Timarchy descends into Oligarchy with the accumulation of wealth in private hands.
    - People become money-loving and extravagant and find ways to disobey the law.
    - Wealth trumps merit as a criterion for selecting rulers.
    - Society splits into rich and poor factions. People disobey the principle of specialization. There are now some people who do no work - the 'drone' class - and are either poor beggars (drones without stings), or rich (drones with stings) who only consume.
    - The oligarchs are afraid to wage wars, since that would arm the people.
    - **Oligarchic character:** He looks at the economic problems faced by his father and realizes the value of money. He places money at the highest in the hierarchy of value. He has a personality split between opposing good and bad forces, but the good dominate the bad ones. He is honest, not out of morality, but rather by constraining evil impulses, for the sake of favorable business transactions.
3. **Democracy (555c - 562a)**
    - People try their best to maximize their wealth. Love of money and self-discipline cannot coexist.
    - The people will realize that the oligarchs care for nothing other than money, and will fight against them - either internally or through external means - and establish a free and equal society (i.e., with equal rights and opportunities).
    - Liberty is the highest value in this society, and people are free to do whatever they want.
    - **_Thought:_** _In 557c Socrates calls Democracy the most attractive of the imperfect societies being discussed. So it seems that he does recognize the virtues of this system above the other imperfect ones._
    - **Democratic character:** He indulges in both the necessary and unnecessary desires equally, and without restraint or order. This is mentioned to be the kind of person who believes in liberty and equality.
4. **Tyranny (562b - 569c)**
    - Excess of liberty leads to the downfall of democracy, just as excess of wealth for oligarchy.
    - People fall in the influence of bad leaders, who intoxicate them with excesses.
    - Extreme liberty permeates all private life - father and son roles are misplaces (reduced respect for father in the name of independence), teachers fear their students, dogs start looking like their owners, slaves have as much liberty as owners, and there is complete equality and liberty in the relations of both sexes.  
        **_Thought:_** _The point on slaves-owner relations is probably reflecting the ideas of those times. Also, it seems Socrates makes a point here that the two sexes should have an asymmetric relationship - i.e., in terms of equality and liberty they should not be considered the same. This could be expanded upon much more, since it is unclear in what sense (and why) does he consider them different (in terms of social dynamics, human nature, etc.?) and whether that is truly an ethical way of looking at male-female dynamics._
    - People become so sensitive that any sort of restraint is seen as intolerable, and thus people disregard written and unwritten rules of society.
    - The 'stinging drone' class are seen as energetic, and rise as leaders. They rob the rich, keep as much as possible for themselves, and distribute the rest to the common people (who are kept in an economic condition where they cannot cause revolution).
    - This starts trials and impeachments - since the rich accuse the leaders of robbing them, and the leaders accuse them as being reactionaries and oligarchs (although they actually have no revolutionary intent) - and a single popular leader is put forward in this struggle as the representative.
    - Once he has "tasted blood" (i.e., gained from a wrong act) he continues with this strategy, and goes on to kill and destroy all his enemies, until he makes himself the tyrant.
    - The popular tyrant initially acts kindly and makes large promises, but eventually disposes off all his enemies and people having ideas of freedom. This makes him unpopular and creates opponent leaders who want to dethrone him - and so he goes on to eliminate them all, and also gets security for his own protection (this security would comprise of slaves taken away from their owner citizens).  
        **_Thought:_** _This is quite an accurate framework given by Socrates which has been seen throughout history in various examples!_
    - Ultimately, the tyrant would grow so powerful that he would even raise his hand against those who fathered him and groomed him to greatness.

The tyrannical character is discussed extensively in Book IX.

## Book 9

**Overview**

Here, the tyrannical character is discussed, completing the discussion of different imperfect cities and souls, which began in Book 8. This is followed by a discussion on the unhappiness of these different imperfect characters, to show that injustice does not really produce the best result for oneself - thus finally answering the question raised by Glaucon and Adeimantus in Book 2.

**The tyrannical character (571a - 576b)**

- In every person there is a reasonable, humane part, and a more sinister, dark, desire-driven part. In the democratic man there is a balance between the necessary and unnecessary desires. But the tyrannical man is the one where the unnecessary desires overtake him. To satisfy these desires, they'll go to any extent of unjust activities - including robbing their own parents.  
    **_Thought:_** _I liked this way in which a person is treated as having both a good and an evil side. This is a common idea discussed by many people commonly, and even in literature._
- The actual tyrant is born when the followers of such "criminals" increase. The tyrant chosen is the one who is the most tyrannical of them all.
- Just as he punished his parents, he will punish his country - and the people will be kept in subjugation, as "slaves". The tyrant will not have any real friends, and all companions will be parasitic - thus he himself also would not have freedom. Thus, this is the most unjust character.

**Happiness in just and unjust characters**

- **576c-e :** The philosopher ruler is claimed to be the happiest, while the tyrant the most unhappy. To understand the true state of happiness or unhappiness of the tyrant, one must go deep into the character's life, beyond the surface at which he is viewed in public, and into his personal life.  
    **_Thought_**_: I liked this approach of Socrates to conduct a deeper analysis. It is easy to go by stereotypical assumptions, and say the rich and powerful are happy, often out of resentment or jealousy. To think deeply about their lives and finding flaws is a good rational way to go about this._
- **577a - 578a -- (City-soul analogy) -- :** In a tyranny, the state is enslaved by the tyrant, and also such a state is poor. Thus the people in such a state are also slaves and poverty-stricken, and consequently are the unhappiest of all.
- **578b - 580c :** The tyrant is not only unhappy just based on the city-soul argument. Socrates shows that he is even more unhappy than that:
  - He is a slave-owner of a large number of slaves, and so is always worried of his safety, and must get protection from some of the slaves, even against his own desire.
  - His companions are parasitic and his own enemies. So he cannot travel or be free out of fear.
  - He can never really fulfill any of his own desires.
  - Due to all these reasons, he has no real freedom, nor any control of himself. Moreover he is run by the darkest parts of his own character. Due to these reasons he is truly much more unhappy than what we would have even considered.
- **580b :** The ideal state (aristocracy / ruled by 'philosopher-ruler'), timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny are said to be states in decreasing order of happiness.
- **580d - 583a -- (Argument of happiness from tripartite division of soul)** -- **:** There are three parts - reason, spirit (honour/success driven), and desire/gain-driven parts. A person who is dominated by any one of these, would consider the other two parts as being of less value. However, if there were to be any dispute between the three kinds of pleasure, only the one with reason can know the truth. Furthermore, the philosopher ruler can experience the other two pleasures, but the "soldierly" person or the money-maker cannot get experience of truth and reality. So the philosopher ruler has an advantage of knowing what is truly best for him, and can lead the pleasantest life of all, followed by the soldierly one, and lastly the money-maker.
- **583b - 587b -- (Argument from illusory pleasure and pain) -- :** There are states of pure pleasure, pure pain, and other states that lie "in-between" both. These "in-between" states may have the appearance of being pleasurable or painful, but in reality they are illusory in nature, since they have a changing nature. Thus, only the one who has knowledge of the highest pure pleasure can tell the difference of real pleasure from the illusory one, while the others would think they experience pleasure without actually having it in its real form. Thus the tyrant really is unhappy, and only the philosopher ruler can be the happiest.
- **587c - 588a :** Socrates makes the argument that the philosopher ruler is 729 times happier than the tyrant.  
    **_Thought_**_: This felt like the weakest argument of all, considering it seemed to make entirely arbitrary assumptions of proportionality of happiness across different states - and then of course went on to make an absurd calculation involving squaring and cubing without any justification whatsoever (perhaps there is some basis to it that is not in the Republic, but part of the way of thinking of their times; but nevertheless it appears clearly implausible to make such a strong numerical claim)._
- **588b - 592a :** Only the just man can be truly happiest. To be just, one's mind must be oriented towards the good, and the darker side of the character must be tamed and not be fed. This, Socrates claims, implies that there is a requirement for there to be a higher guiding wisdom for people - preferably from within them, but otherwise with the guidance of friends and ultimately the law. Only after they are educated this way, can they also be given freedom. On the contrary, the unjust will never be truly happy, answering the question raised in Book 2.  
    **_Thought:_** _This seems to be a very interesting take on the necessity for the balance between order/self-discipline and a "chaotic" freedom. Blind absolute freedom without any sort of guidance can ultimately lead to the detriment of all members of society. From a liberal perspective this does raise a question - if a person chooses through their own free will, to make choices that may lead to their own detriment (and not harm anyone else), should they not be allowed to do so? Perhaps this is an interesting line of debate on its own. One probable way we resolve it generally seems to be through a line dividing children from adults - giving adults more of this freedom to make choices that can harm themselves, whereas children, being under relatively constant supervision and guidance of parents, teachers and others, have a more restricted ability to exercise such freedom of choice, under the justification that they are not cognitively mature enough to understand consequences._
- **592b :** The discussion ends with the relatively solemn thought that it is unclear whether the ideal state could ever exist, but that the philosopher could take part in public affairs only under such an ideal state.

## Book 10

**Overview**

The main discussion of the Republic has ended. Now it seems that they are having an additional conversation following this, which is focused on three broad themes:

1. The theory of art
2. The immortality of the soul
3. The rewards of goodness

**On the inferior status of art**

- **595a : _Thought:_** _I found it quite strange and interesting that Socrates considers the most excellent feature of the ideal state as being its recognition of the inferior status of poetry (and representation in general) - in the sense that it is to be excluded from the ideal state._
- **596b - 598c:** Three ideas of an object are discussed
  - One is the real form of an object itself, which is said to be created by god  
        **_Thought:_** _I find it interesting that Socrates considers the forms as being created by god. Perhaps in his formulation it would make sense, since god is the creator of reality, and the forms are the ultimate reality. But I am curious to know - does he regard the material world of objects as also being created by god? Or does god only create the forms? Because if it is the later, then it is hard to understand how the material objects would manifest themselves from the forms themselves. Interestingly though, this does allow for possibilities like the material objects not requiring any creator (for instance, if the universe always existed infinitely into the past). Besides, having a creator is not an end point solution for explaining away the existence of matter, since it brings about follow-up questions like how did the creator come about? (and so on)._
  - Then there is a particular kind of that object, which is created by a craftsman
  - And finally there is a representation of this (second) object, created by a poet/artist, and is thus at the third away from reality. This is the reason why it is of such inferior nature.
- **598d:** Anyone who claims to know multiple crafts, really knows little about all of them, since he does not know the real form of all those crafts.
- **599b :** Socrates considers a person who knows both a craft and a form, and then claims that such a person would find it pointless to spend time on the craft.  
    **_Thought:_** _I don't understand really why Socrates treats people as perfectly rational agents. It is one thing to even consider that they have a strong grasp of knowledge, but that does not necessitate them to make completely rational use of that (assuming that it were true that it is a logical conclusion to not spend time on the craft)._
- **599c-e :** Here he considers texts that Homer wrote on political constitution and military strategy, and then argues that there are no examples where it has been employed.  
    **_Thought:_** _This is not really an argument at all. Just because an idea has not been used in practice does not prove it wrong. At best it could only be said to be unlikely to be good, but not necessarily so, unless real rational arguments can be made to show it to be wrong._
- **601c - 602a:** Another analogy is discussed, of use, manufacture and representation. The user has actual knowledge. The manufacturer (craftsman) does not have knowledge himself, but takes guidance of the user to make the objects. Finally, the artist/poet represents objects without any knowledge of both the form and the particular object.  
    **_Thought:_** _The analogy is okay, but it is a bit confusing since it seems it does not perfectly align with the first analogy, since there the craftsman simply makes the object, and does not have any knowledge of the form, but here it is said the the user guides the manufacturer._
- **602c - 605c:** Socrates makes the argument that there are two parts in the mind - one is reason, which follows principles; the other is the irrational emotional part, which gives in to feelings (particularly, negative emotions are mentioned by Socrates, which he regards as "womanish", and he says that as per principles we should practice restraint towards such emotions), and these two parts contradict each other. He makes the claim that representations appeal to this lower emotional part of the mind, which is thus a problem.
- **605d - 608b:** He thus argues that art (like poetry, comedy, painting, music, etc.) is not good for society as it encourages people to indulge in this irrational part of the mind and find goodness in the "flaws" of such representations. Thus it should be excluded from the ideal state. However, he then states that if someone can make a good case to defend the importance of poetry in the state then they would allow it to return.  
    **_Thought:_** _I simply do not understand this sudden inconsistency. If his argument was so logical and clear, then why should he need to allow someone the possibility to present a case in support for poetry? I do not have a problem with him having humility here, but it is rather strange then, because throughout the rest of the Republic he made various strong claims through careful argumentation, and never mentioned any allowance for a case to be made against their ideas elsewhere. So is this just really pure humility, or an instance of the very kind of irrational behavior that Socrates himself claimed to be against?_

**On the immortality of the soul**

- **608c,d :** Socrates makes the point that in order to discuss the rewards of goodness, we must analyze such rewards over the entire length of time itself (not just a single lifespan of a body) - the reason for this being that the soul is immortal.
- **608d - 611a -- (Argument for immortality of the soul) -- :** Good is that which preserves and benefits, whereas evil is that which harms or destroys. He also defines a "specific evil" that everything possesses - such as illness for the body, rot for timber, rust for iron, etc. - and he makes the claim that anything can only be truly destroyed by its own specific evil. The specific evil of something else can only cause harm, but not destroy this thing, unless it indirectly brings about the specific evil of the thing itself too. If there is such a thing that cannot be destroyed by its specific evil, that that thing is thus indestructible. Here, Socrates then says, that disease can destroy the body, but the specific evils of the soul (injustice, indiscipline, cowardice, ignorance, etc.) only harm it, but cannot destroy it - thus the soul must be immortal.  
    **_Thought:_** _I found the ideas of "good" and "evil" to be quite fascinating. But the way he has treated the concept of "specific evil" seems to be hardly clear of problems. The basic claim that a thing can only be truly destroyed by its specific evil seems obviously false, which can be seen through his own example of timber - since fire can destroy timber (without any requirement for rot). Additionally, a very big assumption has been made - that injustice, indiscipline, etc. evils cannot destroy the soul. How can you claim that a thing can/cannot destroy the soul is the idea of "soul" has itself not been defined? What is the soul, and how is it constituted? Without knowledge of this, how can we make such assumptions? - especially since the entire argument rests on this assumption.  
    To try to understand this better myself, I can think up of two different ways in which the idea of a "soul" could be vaguely defined: (a) That hypothetical part of oneself that has freewill and consciousness, and is somehow contained in the body (probably the brain?) and uses the word "I" in self-reference (i.e., when not referring to the physical body). This concept is pretty complicated (if real), and it is quite possible that it has a biological manifestation fundamentally, in which case it is not really immortal, and gets destroyed along with the brain. (b) An idea of a person, that the person themselves, as well as all people who know him, share, in a kind of "essence" that contains all his fundamental defining characteristics - which could perhaps be thought of in Plato's terminology as a "form of the self". This concept could be immortal in a way, since ideas exist abstractly even after the death of the physical body of the person. But it is still only an idea, not an entity that contains some of the popularly thought-of features of a soul, like freewill and consciousness - i.e., the soul is not a life itself. But this is already getting much ahead of our discussion._
- **611a :** He makes the claim that the number of souls in total must be fixed always, since they cannot be destroyed, and also cannot be created since that would be at the expense of mortals.  
    **_Thought:_** _What is the justification for this later claim?_
- **611c - 612a :** To know the rewards of goodness, we must look at the soul in its true form - i.e., being aligned with the love of wisdom.

**On the rewards of goodness**

- **612b :** Socrates says that we now know that justice is inherently good for the true self, irrespective of any rewards or consequences.  
    **_Thought:_** _Maybe I am not able to understand this clearly, but how exactly did he show this? And if the argument is the justice helps bring the best soul out, then is that not just another kind of consequentialistic reason?_
- **612c - 613e -- (Rewards of goodness in life itself) -- :** He now considers the case of two men, one being just but appearing unjust, and the second being unjust but appearing just - and discusses the rewards they each receive from gods and other men. The gods give them both their true share of rewards, since the gods know everything. If the gods punish the truly just man, that is only for wrong deeds from his previous life. With regards to rewards from other men - it is explained that although the unjust man may appear to benefit initially in life, in the long run the truly just man is the one who will come out with the greatest of rewards.  
    **_Thought:_** _That's alright I suppose, and I would even agree to the extent that this may be pretty true on an average if we compare large groups of just and unjust people. But it is not true in the absolute sense - i.e., in any individual case, it is easily possible that a truly just man never gets the reward. For example: There's a person who is honest, kind, and truly good in character, but is bullied throughout childhood, and beaten, and his wrongdoers are never found guilty, and instead he is blamed for the troubles; and then one day while going to school he is hit by a truck and dies - so then he does not really get a "long life" where the 'rewards' could have ever really come his way. In fact, instead of feeling sorry for such a person, I have seen some people, following similar ideas as Plato presents here with regards to the rewards of goodness, making claims like "they must have done something wrong is their past life"! It is as if one were disrespecting the person even after they were dead! This, I think, shows some of the repercussions of such strongly deterministic ideas of rewards for goodness in one's lifetime._
- **614a - 621d -- (The Myth of Er | Rewards of goodness after death) -- :** Socrates explains the rewards of goodness after death, through a story of a man named Er.
  - Er died in battle, and his body was taken to a pyre on the twelfth day - however he came back to life suddenly, and then narrated what he saw.
  - Er's description - of a gaping chasm in the earth and the sky, with the unjust and tortured people coming from the ground, and just and happy people coming from the sky - closely resembles the concept of hell and heaven as described in various religions.
  - It is narrated that all these people are then given a free choice to choose the kind of benefits and character they can have in their next life - but some, out of their foolishness and greed, choose the wrong kind of characters, whereas the wise people (who may have currently come from either heaven or hell) choose simple, just lives. Here Socrates mentions, is the importance of having knowledge of the form of the good, since that is what would truly allow one to make the correct choice, by comparing between good and bad lives.
  - The destinies of all the people are fixed as per their choices. Some with previously bad lives will get a good next life, some with good lives will get a bad next life, and others may continue to have a similar quality kind of life (good/bad) as before. Finally they drink water from a river which causes their memories to disappear (Er was forbidden from drinking it) and then after an earthquake they all shoot out and are thrown into their next lives, into birth (Er returns to his body, at the pyre, with all his memories intact).  
        **_Thought:_** _I was quite fascinated with the extensive use of the ideas of afterlife and rebirth, which is generally a concept only found in religious texts. Of course, it seems that all this relies on the assumption of the immortality of the soul, which itself is a debatable proposition._

With this, the Republic comes to an end.
